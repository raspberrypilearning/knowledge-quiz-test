## Guidelines

The quiz format has been designed to be extremely flexible. Any markdown used in the projects site should work in the quiz.

### Quiz questions

### Quiz answers

On desktop, answers to the quiz questions will appear in a 2x2 grid. On mobile, they will appear in a single column.

#### Examples for answer content

##### Text
[Image of the text button]

Text is the simplest type of answer, and is guaranteed to look good on desktop and mobile.

##### Scratch blocks

Scratch blocks can be used in question answers, but will look best when you follow these guidelines

- Scratch blocks which are too tall will cause scrolling issues meaning the user cannot compare the answer to the question.
- Scratch blocks which are too wide will cause the quiz area to scroll horizontally, meaning it will be more difficult for the user to read the answer options.
